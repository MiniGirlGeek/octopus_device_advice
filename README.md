# Octopus Interview

I was asked to create a small webapp that interacted with the octopus API and one other API.

My solution checks the octopus API to see the price of energy forecast on their flexible tariff. 

You can log tasks that will use energy, but you don't need to complete immediately. It will then add an event to your google calendar at the cheapest time for you to complete that task.
